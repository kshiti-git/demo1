# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- main  # or your branch name

pool:
  name: Default   # 🧠 Use your self-hosted agent pool name

variables:
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'

steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  inputs:
    packageType: 'sdk'
    version: '7.0.x'   # ✅ Change if your project uses another version
    installationPath: $(Agent.ToolsDirectory)/dotnet

- script: dotnet restore
  displayName: '🔧 Restore dependencies'
